# DreamCRM — Project context for Claude

Multi-tenant SaaS for dental clinics. Dream Create (platform owner) runs the
platform; clinics are tenant orgs; patients are users with `role='patient'`
in a clinic org. The Mosaic Next.js admin template provides the dashboard
aesthetic — keep it; wire logic to it rather than replacing components.

## Stack
- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack), TypeScript, Tailwind 4
- **Drizzle ORM** on **Neon Postgres** (US-East, `iad1`)
- **better-auth** with Organizations plugin (multi-tenant)
- **Stripe** for billing (Checkout + Customer Portal + webhooks)
- **Resend** for transactional email (from `Hello@DreamCreateWeb.com`)
- **Vercel Blob** for uploads
- **Vercel** deployment, production URL: **https://dreamcreatestudio.com**
  - Wildcard `*.dreamcreatestudio.com` reserved for clinic public sites
  - Every push to `main` aliases there — refresh, don't open per-deploy URLs

## Multi-tenancy model

- `organization` has `type: 'platform' | 'clinic'`
- `member` links user → org with `role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'member' | 'patient'`
- `session.activeOrganizationId` carries which org the user is operating as
- `getTenantContext()` (in `lib/auth/context.ts`) resolves the current
  request into `{ tenantType, role, planTier, organizationId, patientId, … }`
- Every tenant-scoped table in `lib/db/schema/domain.ts` carries an
  `organization_id` FK (nullable for now — backfill when seed data lands)
- `lib/modules/` defines what each `tenantType` sees in its sidebar (with
  `minPlan` plan-gating and `roles` array role-gating)

**Platform org seeded**: `Dream Create` (`slug: dream-create`, `type: platform`),
with `dustin@dreamcreateweb.com` as the only `member(role: owner)` and
`platformAdmin: true` on the user row.

## Stripe wiring
- Plans live in `lib/stripe-config.ts` (Basic / Pro / Premium, monthly + annual)
- **Note:** the `*_ANNUAL` env vars currently point to the same Stripe prices
  as `*_MONTHLY`. The Plans UI offers annual billing but charges monthly until
  real annual prices are created in Stripe and 3 envs are updated.
- Webhook endpoint `we_…` registered at
  `https://dreamcrm-dreamcreatewebs-projects.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
  (legacy URL — fine, Vercel routes both). Subscribed events:
  `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.{created,updated,deleted,trial_will_end}`,
  `invoice.payment_{succeeded,failed}`
- Platform admin manages subscriptions + plans at `/ecommerce/invoices`
  (gated to `tenantType==='platform' && role in {owner,admin}`)

## What's wired and working
- Auth (sign-in/up/reset, sign-out) with timeout + hard-reload to avoid
  cookie races on the next request
- Onboarding 01→02→03→04 (`sessionStorage` draft → plan picker →
  org+member+clinic_profile + Stripe Checkout)
- Tenant-aware sidebar across all three route groups
- All Mosaic template pages CRUD-wired to DB (customers, orders, invoices,
  tasks, calendar, campaigns, forum, feed, meetups, jobs, inbox, messages,
  shop/cart/pay, settings panels, fintech, analytics)
- Stripe admin UI (subscriptions table + plans CRUD) for platform admins
- Vercel security headers, function timeouts, image remotePatterns
- **Public clinic websites** at `{slug}.dreamcreatestudio.com` (modern
  template — hero / about / hours / services / contact / footer; +/book
  page for pro/premium tiers). Subdomain rewrite in middleware.ts.
- **Clinic site editor** at /settings/clinic — display name, tagline,
  about, full address, contact, brand color, 7-day office hours editor,
  template selector. /settings/locations for multi-location practices.
- **Stripe → clinic_profile** sync: webhook now writes plan_tier /
  stripeSubscriptionId / subscriptionStatus to clinic_profile (org-keyed)
  with 3 fallback paths to resolve the org.
- **Accept-invite flow** at /accept-invite?token=… — token validation,
  sign-up-or-sign-in toggle, auto-accept on submit, patient.userId linkage
  via link-patient.ts.
- **Patient portal** at /patient/* — dashboard with upcoming appointments,
  appointments list (upcoming + history), book a visit (server action,
  future-time validation), profile editor (name/contact/DOB/address),
  bills placeholder. Patient sidebar auto-selected by DashboardShell when
  ctx.tenantType==='patient'. `/` redirects patients to /patient/dashboard.
- **Clinic profile editor enhancements**: logo + hero image uploaders
  wired to Vercel Blob, editable services list (replaces hardcoded 4),
  staff editor with headshot uploads and bios. Modern template renders
  all of it (logo → header letter-mark fallback; hero image with gradient
  overlay; configurable services strip; Meet The Team section that
  auto-hides when empty).
- **Vitest test suite** (108+ tests) covering middleware, billing sync,
  site rendering, server actions, invite-details, link-patient, patient
  booking, profile updates, services/staff JSON parsing.

## What's NOT yet wired (priorities for next session)
1. **DB migration 0001 must be applied to prod** — adds logo_url,
   hero_image_url, services jsonb, staff jsonb to clinic_profile.
   Push the /api/admin/bootstrap route (auth'd by a freshly-rotated
   ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN env), curl it to run pending migrations, then
   remove the route + env.
2. **Subdomain DNS** — `*.dreamcreatestudio.com` wildcard must be added
   to the Vercel project before clinic sites resolve in production.
3. **Real annual Stripe prices** — split the 3 `STRIPE_PRICE_*_ANNUAL` envs
4. **Module recontextualization for clinic admins** — currently Messages /
   Forum / Ecommerce / Customers / Orders / Invoices / Calendar / Tasks
   services don't filter by organizationId. Single-tenant for now so
   this is correctness, not a real leak — but MUST be fixed before
   onboarding clinic #2. Every domain table already carries an
   organization_id FK; the service functions just need:
   `eq(table.organizationId, ctx.organizationId)` in the where clauses,
   plus pass ctx.organizationId on every insert.
5. **Patient bills + records + messages** — the patient portal pages
   exist but bills is a placeholder, records/messages are 'soon' in the
   sidebar registry. Pending real clinic invoicing flow.

## Deployment & operations

- **Production**: `main` branch auto-deploys to `https://dreamcreatestudio.com`
- **Region**: `iad1` (matches Neon)
- **DB migration**: applied via one-time `/api/admin/bootstrap` pattern.
  If you need to apply a new migration, push the bootstrap route (auth'd
  by a freshly-rotated `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` env var), curl it, then
  remove the route + the env var.
- **Webhook secret rotation**: same pattern — `/api/admin/bootstrap` with
  `stripe-setup` action returns the new whsec; PATCH the
  `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var via Vercel API.

## Vercel project facts
- `accountId: team_JCkmr9YSdUoHDEI9kLvznwCc`
- `projectId: prj_HK0PWpVYjcDPZNUUoxIQ5UptBFMS`
- 32 env vars; **no** `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` should be present (rotated out
  after each use)
- Speed Insights + Web Analytics enabled

## Branches
- `main` — production
- `archive/setup-mosaic-prior-work` — backup of the prior clinic SaaS work
  (kept as reference; ports of clinic-public / patient portal / accept-invite
  pages come from here)
- `claude/setup-mosaic-dashboard-Tgzs0` — same content as `archive/…`;
  redundant. Safe to delete via the GitHub UI when convenient.

## Conventions
- Always merge PRs the assistant opens. Stay on `main`. No long-running
  feature branches.
- Service modules live in `lib/services/`, marked `import 'server-only'`.
  Client-safe enums + types live in `lib/types/` or `lib/modules/types.ts`.
- Server actions live next to the route that uses them: `actions.ts` for
  user-facing CRUD, `admin-actions.ts` for platform-admin-only operations
  (which start with a `requireTenant()` + role check).
- All authenticated layouts go through `<DashboardShell>` — don't render
  `<TenantSidebar>` or `<Header>` directly elsewhere.
- After mutating a session field (e.g. `activeOrganizationId`), navigate
  via `window.location.assign()` instead of `router.push()` so middleware
  + tenant context see the new state on the next request.
- Stripe / DB / better-auth clients are lazy `Proxy` instances so
  `next build` can run without runtime envs.

## Useful commands

```bash
pnpm dev                  # local dev (needs .env with the Vercel envs)
pnpm build                # next build
pnpm db:generate          # drizzle-kit generate (after schema changes)
pnpm db:push              # apply schema directly (local dev only)
pnpm typecheck            # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test                 # vitest run (full unit + integration suite)
pnpm test:watch           # vitest in watch mode
```
